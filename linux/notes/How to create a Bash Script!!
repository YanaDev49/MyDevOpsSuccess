In order to create a Bash Script, You need to Open a file using the 'touch' command

E.g touch examplescript.sh (Make sure you add '.sh' at the end of Bash Scripting files to allow the terminal
to Recognise that this file will be executed)

You can edit your bash scripting file using any text editor command for example 'vim' or 'nano'

                      E.g 'vim examplescript.sh'

How to edit your Bash Script using the 'vim' command?

start by pressing 'i' in the 'vim' command to enter '---INSERT---' 

Note: The first line of every Bash Script should begin with with a Shebang line, which looks like this '#!/bin/bash'

So what is a Shebang line?

The shebang line tells your computer to run the Script using bash!
It specifies which interpreter we will use when running the script 

How to add text to your Bash Scripting!!

After you have established the #shebang line, you can start adding text to your file by 
using the 'echo' command followed by the text you want to add.

                       E.g 'echo "Hello everyone"'

Remember to exit ---INSERT--- using the 'Esc' button on your keyboard, and once you 
enter command mode, type 'wq!' to save your changes 

Note: Due to the fact that your bash scripting file is an executable file, you need 
to grant it permissions using the 'chmod' command
